                    My name is Anna, a Californian photographer living in Budapest, Hungary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I consider myself a photographer, specializing in architectural photography. I graduated from 
                    San Francisco State University in 2017, booked a one-way plane ticket to Budapest and haven’t looked back since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the past ten years I've become well-versed with many technical aspects of photography. I 
                    studied black and white darkroom photography, produced prints in a lab setting, and gained extensive 
                    knowledge of photography hardware. For five years I also worked for architectural photographer Vince 
                    Valdes as his production assistant. During these times I had the good fortune to learn the craft from
                    a highly accomplished working professional.
                </p>

                    Get in touch with me if you would like to work with an English speaking professional photographer for architectural, real estate, or family portraits.
