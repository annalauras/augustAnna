            My name is Anna, I'm half Thai, half Hungarian living in Budapest, Hungary.
        </p>
        <p>
            I consider myself a photographer, specializing with toy cameras. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past ten years I've become well-versed with many technical aspects of photography. 
            I studied black and white darkroom photography, produced prints in a lab setting, and gained 
            extensive knowledge of photography hardware. For five years I also worked for architectural 
            photographer Vince Valdes as his production assistant. During these times I had the good fortune 
            to learn the craft from a highly accomplished working professional.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am very passionate about photography and at every opportunity, spend free time
            constantly trying to improve my craft and learn new techniques by taking pictures,
            utilizing toy cameras. I am known to take a camera wherever I go and I like to experiment 
            with a variety of films, which I process at home on my own.
